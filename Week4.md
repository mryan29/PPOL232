- gives them safety and security and access to resources that they fundamentally need to lead a decent life
- you need rule of law to start a business to keep other people from taking the business away from them
- you ened to choose how to allocate limited resources and to whom, choosing collective goods to provide to ppl to help them meet their ends, provide equal opportunity

# Why is democracy promotion good
... or is it?



Problems:
1. inadequate resources
2. lack of domestic consensus
3. conflicting policy objectives
4. limitations of us domestic model

cnt'd. (according to lawson 17):
1. imposing american values
2. sovereignty
3. inconsistency
4. ineffectiveness and unintended consequences

discussion: said it probably isn't good bc although well intended, ends up somewhat imposing american/western way of life and values on other communities, disrupts or throws off balance

democracy would do better when the push for change comes from within

multilateral: south africa got majority rule with lots of help, stopped a partide due to so many sanctions against it so it wasn't economically supported anymore, sanctions came from citizens all over world including western to their govts to impose sanctions
